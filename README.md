## Project Two - Basic JavaScript
> **JS Toybox** *(Made the week of 2/7/2022)*
>
> Small website with multiple pages containing misc. javascript widgets such as calculators, to-do lists and tic-tac-toe. Just to wet my feet in the JavaScript waters before diving into a more complex project down the line.
